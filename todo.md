Create APIs:
1. Admin should create hostel details and employee details.
    - First create employee details (completed)
    - A new student came in hostel (pending)

2. Get all students details of a particular hostel (completed)
3. Get particular hostel details (completed)
4. List those rooms which are vacant.


Issues:
1. keep string representation for Room module as Hostel-Roomnumber
2. number of nights should be equivalent to (check-out-date - check-in-date)
3. Should not allow to create a copy of an employee. (only once it should be created else show return some message) --> resolved
